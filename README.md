# Single-View-Metrology
3D construction of an object from its 2D image using 3 point perspective. The homography and the projection matrices are calculated and are used to apply affine transformations to the image to obtain texture maps.



First run find_corners.py and then Run projection.py

While running find_corners.py. Select 7 points with same sequence as given in report.pdf page 1

And while running projecion.py select top left and bottom right corner of the image that to be included.
